# Python-Code-Challenge

To complete the code challenge, I have chosen first three challenges from the document and worked on the following datasets:

Data.gov
Iris dataset
Wine quality dataset

Tool Used - Google drive's Colab Notebook
Programming Language - Python

I have used Colab Notebook, so in order to execute the three files of .ipynb, you might need to change the path of datasets.

The filnames are as follows:
challenge-1.ipynb
challenge-2.ipynb
challenge-3.ipynb
